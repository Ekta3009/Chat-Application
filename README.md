# Chat-Application
A full-stack mini project implementing real-time chat using Spring Boot for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The project leverages WebSockets via the STOMP protocol to enable real-time messaging. Messages are published to a topic-based message broker and SockJS is used to provide a fallback mechanism.
